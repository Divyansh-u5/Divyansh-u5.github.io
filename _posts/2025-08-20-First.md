Wow! This is my first post on this portfolio and I am so excited about it. After many tries, I have finally made this portfolio run properly - from changing different themes to fixing malfunctioning buttons, and while making it, I also learned a little bit of HTML!

I am currently pursuing BS Data Science from IIT Madras and have a deep passion for data science, Python programming, and DIY electronics projects. Through this portfolio, I'll be sharing my journey of learning, building, and exploring various domains.

From automating content creation workflows to building IoT projects with ESP32, from understanding economic trends to analyzing financial markets - this space will document my experiments, learnings, and perspectives on technology, economics, and everything in between.

Stay tuned for more posts on data science projects, coding tutorials, economic analysis, and creative tech solutions. This is just the beginning of documenting my journey as a student, developer, and curious learner.
