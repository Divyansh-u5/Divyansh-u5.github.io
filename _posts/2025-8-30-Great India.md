Dont go on the title , I am writting this becouse I think any place become great not by its building , not by serenic landscapes , not by its economy 
But by its people , Actually by the action of People . And for now our action has lost their Greatness. 
So here I write something for us , Read it and think once .
*We have failed*
<div align="center">
We have failed.
We have failed to be the people of Bharat.
We say, “We are the people of Bharat.”
But I say — are we, the people of Bharat?
You say, “Yes, we are  great people of Bharat.”
But I say, no — we are great, great  people of Bharat...
...whose sisters screams in  streets alone,
 whose parents’ dreams live in old-age home.
You again say, “Gods are worshiped by the great people of Bharat.”
And I again say, we are the great, great people of Bharat —
who worship Laxmi in the morning,
 and beat her wife in the evening.
who worship the tree in the morning,
 and cut the forest in the evening.
who worship the animal in the morning,
 and kill it for dinner in the evening.
You say, “We succeeded to literate the great people of Bharat.”
And I say, we failed to educate the great, great people of Bharat.
We have failed... to become people of great Bharat.

We have failed.
