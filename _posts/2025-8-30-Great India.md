Dont go on the title , I am writting this becouse I think any place become great not by its building , not by serenic landscapes , not by its economy 
But by its people , Actually by the action of People . And for now our action has lost their Greatness. 
So here I write something for us , Read it and think once .

***We have failed***

<div style="text-align: center;">
We have failed.<br>
We have failed to be the people of Bharat.<br>
We say, “We are the people of Bharat.”<br>
But I say — are we, the people of Bharat?<br>
You say, “Yes, we are  great people of Bharat.”<br>
But I say, no — we are great, great  people of Bharat...<br>
...whose sisters screams in  streets alone,<br>
whose parents’ dreams live in old-age home.<br>
You again say, “Gods are worshiped by the great people of Bharat.”<br>
And I again say, we are the great, great people of Bharat —<br>
who worship Laxmi in the morning,<br>
and beat her wife in the evening.<br>
who worship the tree in the morning,<br>
and cut the forest in the evening.<br>
who worship the animal in the morning,<br>
and kill it for dinner in the evening.<br>
You say, “We succeeded to literate the great people of Bharat.”<br>
And I say, we failed to educate the great, great people of Bharat.<br>
We have failed... to become people of great Bharat.<br>
