#                          Life being Free Flow

  If we see Life , So what is Life ? It is a Mindset of Different People for living and get survived the harsh reallity of Human Society and life . Like life to a Soldier is arena of war where he has to kill enemy for winning . It means he has to end his all problems to win his life While life to Blacksmith is a piece of ironbar , which has to hammered ,grinnedand heated in fire to Shine or to be valuable . Means man has to survive all the problems even these problems hit him hard , he has to survive the heat of tension to Shine.

   When life is just left free of flow then no one live life in his own way . It starts to be lived and controlled by others , Who enjoys to run other life . So if you want to live life in your own way then you have to make your mindset,you have to design your life by your ways , you have to make your mindset of being a human .
